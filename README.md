**Yama** is the god of death in Hinduism, known as the judge of the departed. He embodies righteousness and moral order, enforcing the cosmic laws that govern life and death.

## Thoughts

I am interested in building up a framework that analyzes as many religions as possible and picks up the common themes and sees if it's possible to build up an interface. 

Generally speaking, religion historically seems to have a step ladder, where each religion is sort of based on a predecessar relgiion. 

This is quite easy to understand for Abrahamic religions
